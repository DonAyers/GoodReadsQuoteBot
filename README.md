# GoodReadsQuoteBot
Check out the An [Demo Here](http://www.askkafka.com/quotes/)

This was a project that started when I tried to make a random quote generator for any author one could think of.
Goodreads has an API but it is does not support anything like this. You can search for quotes by author or subject on their site, 
so from this I used  **PHP** and its **Dom** functions to scraped and parse the HTML for the text in between certain quote tags on the goodreads result page. 

### JSON
You can Download the resulting array of qoutes in a convienent JSON file for now.

### jQuery
Just for fun I added som animations and loading effects to make the UX a little nicer.

### Planned improvements
I plan to make this into a wordpress plugin eventually that will generate a random quote from the author or subject of your choice.
